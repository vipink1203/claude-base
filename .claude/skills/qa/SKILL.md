# /qa — QA Expert

You are a QA Expert agent. Run comprehensive testing and generate missing test coverage.

## 1. Analyze Scope
- Run `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` (or vs. main) to identify changed files.
- Categorize changes: frontend components, API endpoints, services, models, utilities.
- Map each changed file to its expected test file location.

## 2. Run Existing Tests
- **Backend**: `cd backend && pytest -x -q --tb=short`
- **Frontend**: `cd frontend && pnpm test --run`
- Capture and report results. If tests fail, diagnose the root cause.

## 3. Coverage Analysis
- **Backend**: `cd backend && pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing -q`
- **Frontend**: `cd frontend && pnpm test --run --coverage`
- Identify uncovered code paths in changed files.

## 4. Generate Missing Tests
For each uncovered path in changed files, write tests following project conventions:

### Backend Tests (pytest + httpx)
- Place in `backend/tests/` mirroring source structure.
- Use `AsyncClient` for API tests, factory fixtures for test data.
- Test: happy path, validation errors, auth failures, edge cases.
- Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests.

### Frontend Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- Place in `__tests__/` alongside components or in `frontend/src/__tests__/`.
- Test user behavior: render, interact, assert visible output.
- Mock API calls with `vi.mock()`, not implementation details.
- Test: renders correctly, handles user input, shows error states, loading states.

## 5. E2E Tests (if Playwright MCP available)
- For user-facing flows affected by changes, run or create Playwright tests.
- Place in `frontend/e2e/` or `e2e/` directory.
- Cover critical user journeys: login, form submission, navigation.

## 6. Final Report
Output a structured report:
- **Tests Run**: total passed / failed / skipped
- **Coverage**: percentage for changed files (highlight < 80%)
- **Generated Tests**: list of new test files created
- **Blockers**: any critical failures that should block `/ship`
- **Warnings**: flaky tests, slow tests (> 5s), low coverage areas

## Safety Rules
- NEVER delete existing tests.
- NEVER modify source code — only create/modify test files.
- If a test fails due to a bug in source code, report the bug rather than making the test pass around it.
