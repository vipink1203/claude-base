## Installation & Setup

### Running the bootstrap script

The simplest way to get started — auto-detects your stack and bootstraps the current directory:

```bash
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh
```

Or target a specific project directory:

```bash
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh ./my-project
```

### Script options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--stack STACK` | | Project type (see [Stack types](#stack-types) below) | `auto` |
| `--db-name NAME` | `-d` | PostgreSQL database name (fullstack/backend only) | `myapp` |
| `--db-port PORT` | `-p` | PostgreSQL port (fullstack/backend only) | `5432` |
| `--skip-install` | `-s` | Generate config files only — skip npm/pip dependency installs | `false` |
| `--dry-run` | `-n` | Preview what would be created without writing any files | `false` |
| `--uninstall` | | Remove all files and configs created by this script | — |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | — |

### Stack types

The script tailors its output based on your project's stack. It auto-detects by default, but you can override:

| Stack | What it sets up | Auto-detected when |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| `fullstack` | All rules, hooks, MCP servers for frontend + backend + DB | Both `frontend/` and `backend/` dirs exist |
| `frontend` | Frontend-only rules/hooks (shadcn/ui, Tailwind, motion.dev, ESLint, Prettier) | `package.json` with `src/app/` or `next.config.*` found |
| `backend` | Backend-only rules/hooks (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Ruff, pytest) | `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` with `app/` dir found |
| `generic` | Stack-agnostic: agents + secrets protection + git hooks only | No frontend or backend indicators detected |
| `auto` | Detect from project files (default) | — |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Explicit stack type
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --stack fullstack ./my-project
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --stack frontend ./my-nextjs-app
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --stack backend ./my-api
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --stack generic ./my-cli-tool

# Custom database settings (fullstack/backend stacks)
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh -d production_db -p 5433

# Config files only — don't install linters/formatters
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --skip-install
```

### What gets created

After running the script, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md                           # Root project context (tech stack, commands, rules)
├── frontend/CLAUDE.md                  # Frontend conventions (if fullstack/frontend)
├── backend/CLAUDE.md                   # Backend conventions (if fullstack/backend)
├── .mcp.json                           # MCP server configs (Playwright, Postgres, Context7)
└── .claude/
    ├── settings.json                   # Hooks pipeline + permission deny lists

    ├── hooks/
    │   ├── end-of-turn-check.sh        # Lint/type check orchestrator
    │   ├── detect-secrets.sh           # PreToolUse secret scanner
    │   └── build-notify.sh             # Audio notification on build/test
    └── rules/
        ├── security.md                 # SQL injection, XSS, auth rules
        ├── frontend/components.md      # shadcn/ui, Lucide, cn() patterns
        ├── frontend/animations.md      # motion.dev conventions
        ├── backend/api.md              # FastAPI async, Depends, Pydantic
        └── backend/database.md         # SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic rules
```

The script also installs tooling dependencies (unless `--skip-install`):
- **Frontend**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Backend**: Ruff, Bandit, pip-audit
- **Both**: The corresponding MCP servers

### Dry run & uninstall

**Preview before committing** — see exactly what would be created:

```bash
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --dry-run
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --dry-run --stack frontend ./my-app
```

**Remove everything** — cleanly undoes the bootstrap:

```bash
# Preview what would be removed
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --uninstall --dry-run ./my-project

# Remove all bootstrap files (with confirmation prompt)
./claude-code-bootstrap.sh --uninstall ./my-project
```

Uninstall removes all generated files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`) and cleans up empty directories. It does **not** uninstall packages (eslint, ruff, bandit, etc.) — remove those manually if needed.

---

## Quick Start

After bootstrapping, start a Claude Code session in your project:

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

That's it. The auto agents (code reviewer + security reviewer) are already active. They run silently at the end of every turn — if they find critical issues, Claude will self-correct before finishing.

You now have access to several agents you can invoke on demand. Try one:

```
> Use the qa agent to check test coverage
```

You'll see something like:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
🧪 QA AGENT (model: sonnet)
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

This confirms which agent is running and on what model.

---

## Understanding the Agent System

Your project comes with **5 agents** organized into two categories:

### Auto Agents (run every turn)

These agents run automatically via **Stop hooks** at the end of every Claude turn. You don't need to invoke them — they're always watching.

| Agent | Model | What it does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 🔍 **code-reviewer** | Sonnet | Reviews changed files for code quality, OWASP Top 10 security, performance issues. Blocks on critical findings. |
| 🛡️ **security-reviewer** | Haiku | Runs Bandit SAST, dependency audit, secret scanning, data flow analysis. Reports only high-confidence, exploitable findings. |

**How they work:**

1. You write code and Claude finishes its turn
2. Stop hooks trigger lint/type checks (tsc, ESLint, Ruff)
3. Code reviewer scans for quality issues
4. Security reviewer scans for vulnerabilities
5. If either finds **Critical** issues → blocks the turn (exit code 2) → Claude sees the error and fixes it
6. If only Warnings/Suggestions → turn completes, report is printed

### Task Agents (user-invoked)

These agents run **only when you ask for them**. They each specialize in a specific workflow.

| Agent | Model | When to use | What it does |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 🚀 **ship** | Sonnet | Ready to commit and push | Creates feature branch, stages files, generates conventional commit message, pushes, opens PR via `gh` |
| 🧪 **qa** | Sonnet | Before shipping | Runs tests (pytest/vitest), analyzes coverage, generates missing tests, runs E2E if Playwright is available |
| 🎨 **ui-review** | Sonnet | After frontend changes | Reviews accessibility, responsive design, shadcn/ui patterns, motion.dev animations, takes Playwright screenshots |

---

## Invoking Agents

There are **two ways** to invoke task agents. Understanding the difference is key.

### Method 1: CLI (new terminal)

Open a **separate terminal** and run:

```bash
claude --agent ship
claude --agent qa
claude --agent ui-review
```

**What happens:** This starts an entirely new Claude session dedicated to that agent. The agent gets:
- Its own context window (clean, focused)
- The model specified in its config (e.g., Sonnet)
- Only the tools listed in its frontmatter
- Full access to the project filesystem

**Best for:**
- Running agents without interrupting your main coding session
- Long-running tasks (full test suite, comprehensive PR review)
- When you want a clean context devoted entirely to one job

### Method 2: In-Session Delegation

From within your **existing Claude session**, ask naturally:

```
> Use the ship agent to commit and open a PR
> Have the qa agent run the test suite
> Use the code-reviewer to look at my recent changes
> Run the ui-review agent on the dashboard component
```

**What happens:** Claude spawns a **subagent** via the Task tool. The subagent:
- Gets its own isolated context window
- Uses the model from its config (e.g., Sonnet for `ship`, Haiku for `security-reviewer`)
- Runs with its restricted tool set
- Returns a summary to your main session when done

Your main session **keeps its context intact** — the subagent's work doesn't pollute your conversation history.

**Best for:**
- Quick checks mid-session ("run qa before I continue")
- Chaining agents ("review, then ship")
- When you don't want to switch terminals

### Which method should I use?

| Scenario | Recommended Method |
|----------|--------------------|
| Deep focus coding session, ready to ship | **CLI** — open Terminal 2, run `claude --agent ship` |
| Quick test check before continuing work | **In-session** — "use the qa agent to run tests" |
| Comprehensive UI accessibility audit | **CLI** — `claude --agent ui-review` (lots of output) |
| Chain review → test → ship in one flow | **In-session** — ask for each agent sequentially |
| CI/CD pipeline automation | **CLI headless** — `claude -p --agent qa "run tests"` |

---

## Identifying Agents

Every agent prints an **identification banner** when it starts, so you always know:
- **Which** agent is running
- **What model** it's using

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
🚀 SHIP AGENT (model: sonnet)
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

Here's the full roster:

| Banner | Agent | Model | Trigger |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| 🔍 CODE REVIEWER | `code-reviewer` | Sonnet | Auto (every turn) |
| 🛡️ SECURITY REVIEWER | `security-reviewer` | Haiku | Auto (every turn) |
| 🚀 SHIP AGENT | `ship` | Sonnet | User-invoked |
| 🧪 QA AGENT | `qa` | Sonnet | User-invoked |
| 🎨 UI REVIEW AGENT | `ui-review` | Sonnet | User-invoked |

If you see no banner, the **main agent** (Opus) is working — not a subagent.

---

## The Quality Pipeline

Bootstrap sets up a multi-layered quality pipeline using Claude Code's **hooks system**. Every code change passes through deterministic checks that Claude cannot bypass.

### What happens on every edit

When Claude writes or edits a file, **PostToolUse hooks** fire immediately:

```
Edit file → Prettier auto-format → ESLint auto-fix → ✅ or ❌ back to Claude
                                 → Ruff check + format → ✅ or ❌ back to Claude
```

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** files: Prettier formats, ESLint fixes what it can
- **Python** files: Ruff checks and formats
- If errors remain after auto-fix, they're sent back to Claude (exit code 2) and Claude fixes them

### What happens at end of turn

When Claude finishes its turn, **Stop hooks** run a comprehensive check:

```
Turn complete → tsc --noEmit (TypeScript check)
             → ESLint full project
             → Ruff check full project
             → 🔍 Code Reviewer agent
             → 🛡️ Security Reviewer agent
             → ✅ Turn allowed to complete
               or
             → ❌ Errors sent back, Claude fixes and retries
```

### The self-correcting loop

The key mechanism is **exit code 2**. When any hook returns exit code 2:

1. Claude's action is **blocked**
2. The error output is **fed back** to Claude as feedback
3. Claude reads the errors, **fixes the issues**, and retries
4. The hook runs again on the new code
5. This repeats until all checks pass

This means Claude literally **cannot** finish a turn with:
- Lint errors
- Type errors
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded secrets

### What hooks block before Claude even writes

**PreToolUse hooks** prevent dangerous operations:

| Protection | What it blocks |
|-----------|---------------|
| Protected files | Writes to `.env`, `.secret`, `package-lock.json`, `.git/`, `node_modules/` |
| Hardcoded secrets | AWS keys (`AKIA`), API keys (`sk-`, `ghp_`), Slack tokens (`xox`) |
| Branch protection | Direct `git push` to `main` or `master` |

---

## Model Allocation

Bootstrap uses a deliberate model allocation strategy to balance quality and cost:

| Role | Model | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Main coding agent** | Opus (your default) | Complex reasoning, architecture, code generation |
| **Code reviewer** (auto) | Sonnet | Good for pattern matching, cheaper per turn |
| **Security reviewer** (auto) | Haiku | Fast scanning, regex matching — runs every turn so cost matters |
| **ship, qa, ui-review** (on demand) | Sonnet | Workflow execution with tool access |

**Only your main coding agent uses Opus.** All other agents run on cheaper models, enforced by the `model:` field in each agent's frontmatter. This keeps costs manageable while maintaining quality where it matters.

**Estimated cost:** ~$6/developer/day or $100–200/month with typical usage.

---

## Workflows

### Solo developer workflow

**Option A: Multi-terminal (recommended for larger features)**

```bash
# Terminal 1: main coding session (Opus)
claude
> Implement user profile page with avatar upload
  ... Claude codes, auto-review runs at end of turn ...
  ... if critical issues found, Claude auto-fixes ...

# Terminal 2: review & ship (Sonnet)
claude --agent ui-review    # reviews a11y, responsive, component patterns
claude --agent qa            # runs tests, generates missing coverage
claude --agent ship          # creates branch, commits, pushes, opens PR
  # → PR: https://github.com/you/repo/pull/42
```

**Option B: Single-session (great for quick iterations)**

```
> Implement user profile page with avatar upload
  ... Claude codes, auto-review runs at end of turn ...

> Use the qa agent to run tests and check coverage
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  🧪 QA AGENT (model: sonnet)
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  Tests Run: 47 passed, 0 failed
  Coverage: 83% (profile.tsx: 91%, avatar-upload.tsx: 76%)
  Generated: tests/profile.test.tsx

> Use the ship agent to commit and open a PR
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  🚀 SHIP AGENT (model: sonnet)
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  Branch: feat/user-profile-avatar
  Commit: feat(profile): add user profile page with avatar upload
  PR: https://github.com/you/repo/pull/42
```

### Team workflow

For teams, the bootstrapped configuration is committed to git so everyone gets the same quality pipeline:

```
.claude/
├── agents/              # Shared agent definitions
├── hooks/               # Shared quality hooks
├── rules/               # Shared coding rules
├── settings.json        # Shared hooks + permissions
└── settings.local.json  # Personal overrides (gitignored)
```

Each developer can add personal overrides in `.claude/settings.local.json` without affecting the team config.

### CI/CD integration

Use Claude Code's headless mode (`-p` flag) in CI pipelines:

```bash
# In GitHub Actions or similar
claude -p --agent qa "Run the full test suite and report results"
claude -p --agent security-reviewer "Scan all changed files for security issues"
```

The official [`anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) GitHub Action supports responding to `@claude` mentions in PRs and issues.

---

## Context Management

Context is Claude Code's most critical resource. Performance degrades non-linearly as the 200K token window fills.

### Best practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use `/clear` between unrelated tasks | Stale context wastes tokens on every subsequent message |
| Stop at ~75% context usage | The final 20% of context produces 80% of errors |
| Use `/rename` before clearing | So you can `/resume` the session later if needed |
| Keep CLAUDE.md under 150 lines | Every line is reprocessed with each message |
| Delegate to subagents | They get their own clean context windows |

### The "Document & Clear" pattern

For complex features spanning multiple sessions:

```
> Write your implementation plan to docs/plan-avatar-upload.md
  ... Claude dumps its plan and progress ...

> /rename avatar-upload
> /clear

> Read docs/plan-avatar-upload.md and continue implementing
  ... fresh session with clean context, full plan preserved ...
```

---

## Customization

### Changing agent models

Edit the `model:` field in any agent's frontmatter:

```yaml
# .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md
---
model: sonnet    # change to "haiku", "opus", or "inherit"
---
```

Available values:
- `sonnet` — balanced quality/cost
- `opus` — highest quality, highest cost
- `haiku` — fastest, cheapest
- `inherit` — uses whatever model your main session uses

### Adding new agents

Create a new `.md` file in `.claude/agents/`:

```yaml
# .claude/agents/docs-writer.md
---
name: docs-writer
description: Documentation agent. Use when the user wants to generate or update documentation, READMEs, or API docs.
model: sonnet
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Edit
  - Write
---

**FIRST:** Always begin your output with this identification banner:
\```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
📝 DOCS WRITER (model: sonnet)
═══════════════════════════════════════════
\```

You are a documentation specialist. When invoked, analyze the codebase and generate
or update documentation...
```

**Tips for good agent definitions:**
- Write **action-oriented descriptions** — "Use when the user wants to..." helps Claude's auto-delegation match correctly
- Include the **identification banner** so users can see which agent is running
- Restrict **tools** to only what the agent needs (principle of least privilege)
- Set the **model** explicitly — don't rely on `inherit` for specialized agents

### Modifying hooks

Edit `.claude/settings.json` to change what runs on each event:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "your-custom-command-here"
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Hook types:
- **PreToolUse** — runs *before* Claude writes (block dangerous actions)
- **PostToolUse** — runs *after* each edit (auto-format, lint)
- **Stop** — runs at *end of turn* (comprehensive validation)
- **Notification** — runs on permission prompts (audio alerts)

### Adding MCP servers

Edit `.mcp.json` to add new MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    },
    "postgres": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp"]
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_PAT}"}
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't respond to in-session invocation

**Symptom:** You say "use the ship agent" but Claude handles it directly instead of delegating.

**Fix:** Be more explicit:
```
> Use the ship subagent to commit my changes
> Delegate to the qa agent to run tests
> Invoke the code-reviewer agent on the files I changed
```

If that doesn't work, check that the agent file exists in `.claude/agents/` and has a valid `description:` field in its frontmatter.

### Hooks are running but not blocking issues

**Symptom:** Lint errors get through even though hooks are configured.

**Check:**
1. Ensure the tools are installed (`npx eslint --version`, `ruff --version`)
2. Run the hook command manually to see if it produces output
3. Check that the hook exits with code 2 on errors (not code 1)

### Auto agents produce too much noise

**Symptom:** Code reviewer / security reviewer flag issues on every turn when you're just exploring.

**Options:**
1. Temporarily disable by editing `.claude/settings.json` — comment out the Stop hook agents
2. Use `.claude/settings.local.json` for personal overrides (this file is gitignored):
   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "Stop": []
     }
   }
   ```

### Context fills up too fast

**Symptoms:** Quality degrades, Claude forgets earlier instructions, responses become generic.

**Fix:**
1. Run `/clear` between unrelated tasks
2. Delegate heavy work to subagents (they don't consume your main context)
3. Use `/cost` to monitor token usage
4. Break large features into smaller sessions with the "Document & Clear" pattern

## FAQ

**Q: Do auto agents cost money?**
A: Yes. The code-reviewer (Sonnet) and security-reviewer (Haiku) each make API calls at the end of every turn. At typical usage (~$6/day), this is a small fraction of total cost. If cost is a concern, switch both to Haiku or disable them.

**Q: Can I use agents from other projects?**
A: Yes. You can place agents in `~/.claude/agents/` for user-level agents available in all projects, or use `claude --agents '{...}'` to define agents inline for a single session.

**Q: Do subagents have access to my conversation history?**
A: No. Subagents get their own isolated context window. They inherit `CLAUDE.md` project context, MCP servers, and skills, but **not** your conversation history.

**Q: Can a subagent spawn other subagents?**
A: No. Claude Code enforces a single-level delegation hierarchy — subagents cannot spawn sub-subagents.

**Q: How do I know if the main agent or a subagent is responding?**
A: All agents print an identification banner (e.g., `🚀 SHIP AGENT (model: sonnet)`). If you see no banner, it's your main agent responding.

**Q: What's the difference between agents and skills?**
A: **Agents** are subagents with their own context windows and tool sets — they run independently and return results. **Skills** are instruction files that Claude reads and follows within the current context — they don't spawn a separate agent.

**Q: Can I run agents in the background?**
A: Yes. Ask Claude to "run this in the background" or press `Ctrl+B` to background a running task. Background agents auto-deny permissions not pre-approved.

**Q: How do I see all available agents?**
A: Use the `/agents` command within a Claude session to view, create, edit, and delete agents.
